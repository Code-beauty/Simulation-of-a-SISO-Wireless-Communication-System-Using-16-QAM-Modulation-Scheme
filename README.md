The Information Age which began in the latter half of the 20th century has brought about major impacts in modern society, accompanied by powers of digital computing and communication technology. Consequently, studying and conducting research in the field of information theory, and in digital communication particularly has always been prioritized. The sole purpose of studying information theory is to understand how information is quantified, stored, and most importantly, communicated through different environments. Therefore, designing a decent system for the information, which is represented as sequences of binary digits, to be propagated thoroughly and error-free be-tween transmitter and receiver could be considered as the most fundamental task of digital communication.
